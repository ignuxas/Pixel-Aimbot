# Pixel-Aimbot
An app that reads your screen and snaps your mouse to certain color of pixels.

This app is designed to lock onto enemies on the screen without reading the game's memory. It works by analyzing the screen in real-time, identifying the brightest pixels, and calculating the middle of those pixels to determine the location of enemies. This process is repeated more than 240 times per second, allowing the app to provide fast and accurate tracking of enemies.
